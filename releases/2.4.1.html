<h1>Release Notes: October 28, 2018</h1>

<h2>Hello, 2.4.1!</h2>

<p>
  Today, we're shipping xUnit.net 2.4.1; this includes RTM builds of the core
  framework and the Visual Studio runner. This build is primarily a maintenance
  release for 2.4, and represents what we hope is the final build in the 2.x
  lifetime.
</p>

<p>
  It's been 3 months since the release of <a href="2.4">2.4 RTM</a>. The small
  number of issues fixed here are due to the relative stability of the codebase
  especially as we turn our focus to working on 3.0.
</p>

<p>
  xUnit.net version 1.x was really about perfecting the experience of writing
  unit tests for the desktop CLR. Version 2.x expanded support for many
  platforms, including .NET Core, Xamarin (iOS and Android), UWP, and others
  along the way. Now that we've reached the edges with the current platforms,
  it's time for us to focus on 3.0. The <a
  href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22target%3A+3.0%22">3.0
  issues list</a> is where you can track our work towards the next major
  version. Please feel free to open any new issue for any bug or missing feature
  that you'd like considered for the 3.0 time frame.
</p>

<p>
  As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of
  xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. We had too many
  contributors this time around to thank individually, so know that every bug
  reported, every line of code PR'd, every conversation contributed to on Slack,
  were all appreciated!
</p>

<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p><em>
  These release notes reflect the entirety of the changes between 2.4 and 2.4.1.
</em></p>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with xunit.abstractions not correctly
    installing with older versions of Visual Studio (pre-2017).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with ByRef types with .NET Core 2.1.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Removed an unnecessary first chance exception related
    to attempting to load configuration files.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where synchronous and asynchronous
    disposal of test classes were running in parallel. The documented behavior
    is that asynchronous disposal (via <code>IAsyncLifetime</code>) runs to
    completion before synchronous disposal (via <code>IDisposable</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue caused in 2.4 by introducing new
    <code>netstandard2.0</code> libraries. Developers who were using desktop CLR
    versions older than 4.7.2 could encounter assembly loading issues. We rolled
    this change back, which should resolve the issue for those users. For more
    information on this problems caused by the original change, see <a
    href="https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/481">this Github issue</a>.
  </li>
  <li>

    correctly resolved when passing a <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Console runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where <code>-nocolor</code> was not
    honored (when trying to get any reports other than XML v2 from the .NET Core
    1.x runner).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with XML element order with the NUnit
    report.
  </li>
</ul>
