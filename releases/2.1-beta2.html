<h2>Visual Studio Runner 2.1 Beta 2</h2>

<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see
  <a href="../docs/running-tests-in-vs.html">Running xUnit.net tests in Visual
  Studio</a>.
</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Test discovery failures were being reported with error
    messages, which caused Team Build to report projects with mixed .NET and
    C/C++ projects to be "Partially Successful", even though all appropriate
    unit tests passed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Diagnostic message output was missing the xUnit.net
    banner and execution time.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>DNX Runner 2.1 Beta 2</h2>

<p class="note">
  The ASP.NET runner has been renamed to the DNX runner, and is now capable of running
  unit tests for all DNX-based projects (not just ASP.NET v5). The runner package has
  been renamed (<code>xunit.runner.aspnet</code> => <code>xunit.runner.dnx</code>) as
  has the GitHub project (now at
  <a href="https://github.com/xunit/dnx.xunit">https://github.com/xunit/dnx.xunit</a>).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added support for DNX Beta 4 (including ASP.NET 5 Beta 4).</li>
  <li>Support for running tests in Visual Studio requires VS 2015 RC or later.</li>
  <li>
    Source line mappings are now available in Visual Studio when running DNX
    tests, which means you can click on test method names in Test Explorer to jump
    directly to the unit test now.
  </li>
</ul>
