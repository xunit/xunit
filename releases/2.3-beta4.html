<h1>Release Notes: August 14, 2017</h1>

<h2>xUnit.net 2.3 Beta 4</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Update to <code>xunit.analyzers</code> version 0.6.0.</li>
  <li>
    Added support for .NET Core 2.0. Both <code>dotnet-xunit</code> and <code>xunit.console</code>
    now ship with .NET Core 1.0 and 2.0 builds, due to limitations in the way that the .NET
    SDK will not promote 1.0 to 2.0 via <code>prefercliruntime</code>. Other runners did not
    require 2.0-specific builds.
  </li>
  <li>Ensured that all .NET Core 1.0 projects were built against 1.0.0 instead of 1.0.5.</li>
  <li>
    <b>BUG:</b> Fixed an issue where grandparent and higher classes were not being correctly
    traversed to find test method info.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual Studio runner</h3>
<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see
  <a href="../docs/getting-started-desktop.html#run-tests-visualstudio">Running
  tests with Visual Studio</a> in the Getting Started documentation.
</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ongoing performance improvements.</li>
  <li>
    <b>BUG:</b> Fixed an issue where .NET Core tests were not correctly running on machines
    with desktop .NET 4.7 installed.
  </li>
</ul>
