<h1>Release Notes: September 1, 2017</h1>

<h2>xUnit.net 2.3 Beta 5</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Update to <code>xunit.analyzers</code> version 0.7.0.</li>
  <li>
    Added the ability to disable cross-collection parallelization for individual
    test collections, via the test collection definition (by setting
    <code>[CollectionDefinition(DisableParallelization = true)]</code>). Parallel-capable
    test collections will be run first (in parallel), followed by parallel-disabled
    test collections (run sequentially).
