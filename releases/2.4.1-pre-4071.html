<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue caused in 2.4 by introducing new <code>netstandard2.0</code> libraries.
    Developers who were using desktop versions older than 4.7.2 could encounter assembly loading issues.
    We rolled this change back, which should resolve the issue for those users. For more information on this
    issue, see <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/481">this Github issue</a>.
  </li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Console runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where <code>-nocolor</code> was not honored (when trying to get any
    reports other than XML v2 from the .NET Core 1.x runner).
