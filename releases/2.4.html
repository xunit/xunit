<h1>Release Notes: July 16, 2018</h1>

<h2>Hello, 2.4!</h2>

<p>
  Today, we're shipping xUnit.net 2.4; this includes RTM builds of the core framework
  and the Visual Studio runner.
</p>

<p>
  It's been 9 months since the release of <a href="2.3">2.3 RTM</a> and the
  <a href="2.3.1">2.3.1</a> bug fix. The length of time is an indicator of
  the relative stability of the 2.3 release train; most of the features
  shipped in 2.4 are usability-related. This includes features like improved test
  method display name formatting, support for reporting results to VSTS, and
  additional command line options for the console runner.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, this release also removes the <code>dotnet xunit</code> runner,
  as the stability of the runner was never perfect, and it suffered from many
  assembly-loading related issues. Users from .NET Core can continue to use VSTest
  (either inside Visual Studio, or via <code>dotnet test</code>).
</p>

<p>
  xUnit.net version 1.x was really about perfecting the experience of writing unit
  tests for the desktop CLR. Version 2.x expanded support for many platforms, including
  .NET Core, Xamarin (iOS and Android), UWP, and others along the way. Now that we've
  reached the edges with the current platforms, it's time for us to focus on 3.0.
  The <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22target%3A+3.0%22">3.0
  issues list</a> is where you can track our work towards the next major version.
</p>

<p>
  As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success
  of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. We had too many
  contributors this time around to thank individually, so know that every bug
  reported, every line of code PR'd, every conversation contributed to on Slack,
  were all appreciated!
</p>
