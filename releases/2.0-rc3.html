<h1>Release Notes: February 23, 2015</h1>

<h2>xUnit.net 2.0 RC 3</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed several issues related to the new serialization system:
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for <code>Boolean</code> (and nullable)</li>
      <li>Added support for <code>Enums</code> (and nullable)</li>
      <li>Added support for <code>DateTime</code> (and nullable)</li>
      <li>Added support for <code>DateTimeOffset</code> (and nullable)</li>
      <li>Added support for <code>Type</code></li>
      <li>Fixed an issue where null strings were treated as empty strings</li>
      <li>Fixed issues related to serializing generics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Console Runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added <code>-nunit</code> switch to output NUnit XML (currently only
    supports a single assembly due to limitations in the NUnit XML format).
  </li>
  <li>
    Assemblies which don't run any tests are no longer treated as an error.
    These assemblies show up in yellow in the assembly run summary so that
    users can more easily tell that no tests were run for that assembly.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>MSBuild Runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Assemblies which don't run any tests are no longer treated as an error.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mono</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed several issues related to compiling the xUnit.net source with xbuild</li>
</ul>
