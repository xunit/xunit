<h1>Release Notes: March 9, 2015</h1>

<p class="important">
  Support for ASP.NET 5 has been removed from this build in preparation for
  RTM. Once 2.0 goes RTM, a new beta build (2.1 Beta 1) will be released which
  restores ASP.NET 5 support. If you're using ASP.NET 5, you can continue to
  use <a href="../docs/getting-started-aspnet.html">this documentation</a>
  (and continue to use <code>rc3</code> in your version numbers).
</p>

<h2>xUnit.net 2.0 RC 4</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The old NuGet package <code>xunit.runners</code> was split into two separate
    packages: <code>xunit.runner.console</code> and
    <code>xunit.runner.msbuild</code>. The latter automatically makes the
    <code>&lt;xunit&gt;</code> task available from within the project file
    (.csproj, .vbproj, etc.). With this new behavior, you can easily add
    targets which invoke the MSBuild runner, and you won't need to update
    your projects by hand when upgrading to a new version of xUnit.net.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed a serialization issue related to open generic
    types (f.e., <code>IEnumerable&lt;&gt;</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Resolved an issue where enum types were not always
    able to be deserialized, but which wasn't discovered until the
    deserialization was attempted. Now, enums from GAC assemblies will just
    refuse serialization; the end result of this is that theories which use
    GAC-based enum values (like those from the CLR itself) will not be
    individually runnable from within Visual Studio (there will be a single
    test case for all theory data members).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Improved diagnostics around incorrectly configured and misbehaving
    test collection orderers and test case orders.
  </li>
  <li>
    A <code>-serialize</code> switch was added to the console runner to force
    it to serialize and de-serialize all discovered test cases. This should
    aid developers who need to debug through their test case serialization
    code, without forcing them to use the MSBuild or Visual Studio runners.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Developers who write extensibility libraries that are linked against the
      execution library can now decorate their assemblies and extensibility
      points to indicate that they support multiple platforms. This is useful
      for any type which is serialized (such as test cases) or for any time you
      need to provide a type name and assembly name to an extensibility
      registration attribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three steps that the developer should do to opt into this new
      behavior:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Name your assemblies with the correct platform suffixes (for example,
        <code>MyAssembly.desktop.dll</code>). The currently supported suffixes
        are:
        <ul>
          <li><code>desktop</code> (for desktop CLR)</li>
          <li><code>iOS-Universal</code> (for Xamarin iOS Universal)</li>
          <li><code>MonoAndroid</code> (for Xamarin Mono Android)</li>
          <li><code>MonoTouch</code> (for Xamarin Mono Touch)</li>
          <li><code>universal</code> (for universal Windows 8.1/Windows Phone 8.1)</li>
          <li><code>win8</code> (for Modern Windows 8)</li>
          <li><code>wp8</code> (for Windows Phone 8 Silverlight)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that on some platforms, the file system may be case sensitive,
          so please use the exact casing shown here.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Decorate your assemblies with an attribute which lets the system know
          that it is a platform specific assembly:<br />
          <code>[assembly: PlatformSpecificAssembly]</code>
          (<a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/219c18e8be841c38a50f2f4dd4285f902ea5af5d/src/xunit.execution/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs#L22">example</a>).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Decorate your extensibility point registrations with an assembly name
          that substitutes <code>{Platform}</code> for the platform part of
          the assembly name
          (<a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/219c18e8be841c38a50f2f4dd4285f902ea5af5d/src/xunit.core/FactAttribute.cs#L12">example</a>).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Note: Developers who are writing extensions but only
      intend to support the desktop platform do not need to do any of these
      steps.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>MemberDataAttribute</code> class implementation was split into
    a base class (<code>MemberDataAttributeBase</code>) which better facilitates
    behavior reuse.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Console Runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with NUnit output and multiple test
    assemblies.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>TestDriven.NET Runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The progress bar during runs should be more useful now. :)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mono</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A new solution file (<code>xunit.xbuild.sln</code>) has been added to
    facilitate Mono builds on Linux and OS X using XBuild. A build shell
    script will be added before RTM to make this process easier.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Visual Studio Runner 2.0 RC 4</h2>

<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see
  <a href="../docs/running-tests-in-vs.html">Running xUnit.net tests in Visual
  Studio</a>.
</em></p>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> This release supports all released versions of
  xUnit.net v1.x, as well as v2.0 RC 4 or later. It does not support any
  earlier versions of xUnit.net v2.x.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>There were no issues fixed for this release.</li>
</ul>
