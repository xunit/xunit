<h1>Release Notes: November 6, 2016</h1>

<p class="note">
  We will be deprecating <code>dotnet-test-xunit</code> once .NET CLI Preview 3 ships. The
  new Visual Studio runner (2.2 beta 4) supports .NET Core tests from the command line
  (<code>dotnet test</code>) as well as inside the next release of Visual Studio "15".
  There will be no more stand-alone .NET Core runner package.
</p>

<h2>Special Thanks</h2>

<p>
  We wanted to highlight the amazing work that <a href="https://github.com/hughbe">Hugh Bellamy</a>
  has done recently. The majority of the new features that shipped in Beta 4 were
  provided by him, and there's more to come. Kudos, Hugh!
</p>

<h2>xUnit.net 2.2 Beta 4</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added support to <code>[MemberData]</code> to allow it to use members
    from derived types.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dramatically improved support for generics in test methods (for complete coverage,
    see the <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/2.2-beta4/test/test.xunit.execution/ResolveGenericMethodTests.cs">unit
    tests</a>).
  </li>
  <li>Added support for theory methods with optional parameters.</li>
  <li>Added support for theory methods with params arrays.</li>
  <li>Added support for inherited traits attributes on test classes.</li>
  <li>Added support for serializing multi-dimensional arrays in theory data.</li>
  <li>Added a completion timestamp to xUnit v2 XML, and the HTML report.</li>
  <li>Added a guard against theory data enumerators throwing.</li>
  <li>Added a guard against theory data providers returning <code>null</code>.</li>
  <li>More performance improvements.</li>
  <li><strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with serializing negative zero floats/doubles.</li>
  <li><string>BUG:</strong> Fixed a bug with invalid characters written to <code>ITestOutputHelper</code>.
</ul>

<h3>Assertion library</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>Assert.All</code> now includes the faulty item in the failure message.</li>
  <li>
    Improve compatibility of <code>Assert.Equal</code> when given two equivalent collections
    that are different types (f.e., <code>string[]</code> and <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code>).
  </li>
  <li>Added a guard against <code>IEnumerable</code> implementations throwing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Console runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added wildcard support (<code>*</code> and <code>?</code>) in the <code>-method</code>
    command line option.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    There is a slight breaking contract with <code>XunitFilters</code> wherein
    <code>IncludedMethods</code> was changed from exposed as <code>HashSet&lt;string&gt;</code>
    to <code>ICollection&lt;string&gt;</code>, in order to better support the new
    wildcard method feature. Hopefully this will have minimal impact on runner
    authors.
  </li>
</ul>
