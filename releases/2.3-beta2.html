<h1>Release Notes: May 8, 2017</h1>

<p class="note">
  Support for UWP projects in Visual Studio is currently broken in 2.3 beta 2. There was
  insufficient time to resolve this issue. UWP users are advised to continue to use 2.3 beta 1
  or earlier. You can <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1267">track the issue here</a>.
</p>

<h2>xUnit.net 2.3 Beta 2</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The new <code>xunit.analyzers</code> project is automatically included when you add a
    reference to the <code>xunit</code> NuGet package. If you would prefer not to include
    the analyzers, please reference the <code>xunit.core</code> NuGet package instead (and
    <code>xunit.assert</code> if you use the built-in assertions).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>dotnet xunit</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BREAKING CHANGE:</strong> In order to support the new <code>-nobuild</code> switch,
    the minimum version of the <code>xunit</code> (and <code>xunit.core</code>) NuGet packages
    is 2.3 beta 2.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>-nobuild</code> switch was added, which allows tests to run without being re-built.
    This should improve compatibility with projects which cannot be built with <code>dotnet msbuild</code>,
    as well as improving startup performance when the project has already been built.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>-usemsbuild</code> switch was added, which allows all interaction with the project
    to be done via <code>msbuild.exe</code> instead of <code>dotnet msbuild</code>. Most users should
    not need this switch. It is assumed that <code>msbuild.exe</code> v15 is available on the
    <code>PATH</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Standard parameter names <code>--framework/-f</code>, <code>--configuration/-c</code>,
    <code>--fx-version</code>, and <code>--no-build</code> are now supported for feature
    parity with <code>dotnet test</code>. The preferred names (<code>-framework</code>,
    <code>-configuration</code>, <code>-fxversion</code>, and <code>-nobuild</code>) are
    the only ones documented in <code>dotnet xunit -?</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG FIX:</strong> Running desktop CLR tests on Mono should now correctly
    invoke <code>mono</code> (or <code>mono64</code>) as appropriate on Linux or
    OS X. It is assumed that Mono is available via the <code>PATH</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG FIX:</strong> Fixed an issue where command line parameters (like
    <code>-namespace</code>) could not be specified more than once.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Console runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BREAKING CHANGE:</strong> The <code>xunit.runner.console</code> NuGet package
    has been changed; notably, the path to the <code>net452</code> executables has moved from
    <code>tools\</code> to <code>tools\net452\</code>. You will need to update any paths which
    previously hard-coded this path.
  </li>
  <li>
    The .NET Core console runner is now included in the <code>xunit.runner.console</code>
    NuGet package. Since this has to be invoked via the undocumented <code>dotnet exec</code>,
    this is here for advanced scenarios only. Most users should continue to rely on
    <code>dotnet xunit</code> to invoke the console runner, as described in our
    <a href="../docs/getting-started-dotnet-core.html">Getting Started</a> page
    for .NET Core.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>MSBuild runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BREAKING CHANGE:</strong> The <code>xunit.runner.msbuild</code> NuGet package
    has been changed; notably, the names of the MSBuild runner DLLs now include the
    target platform. This means if you had a hard-coded path to <code>xunit.runner.msbuild.dll</code>,
    this will need to be replaced with <code>xunit.runner.msbuild.net452.dll</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    This build includes a new .NET Core version of the MSBuild runner. It is used in the same
    manner as the existing desktop CLR MSBuild runner, and the NuGet package has been updated
    to automatically import the correct runner based on whether you're using <code>msbuild</code>
    vs. <code>dotnet msbuild</code>. Note: unlike <code>dotnet xunit</code>, the desktop CLR runner
    can only run desktop CLR test projects, and the .NET Core runner can only run .NET Core
    test projects.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>XunitTestCaseRunner</code> has several new override methods that make it easier to
    extend specific parts of the pipeline (creating tests, the test runner, and supplementing
    the before/after attributes for a test).
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>XunitTestFrameworkDiscoverer</code> has exposed the mapping between <code>Fact</code>-derived
    attributes and the discoverer that is used to find them, allowing the user easier access to
    the cache (as well as allowing them to pre-seed the cache).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Visual Studio Runner 2.3 Beta 2</h2>

<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see
  <a href="../docs/getting-started-desktop.html#run-tests-visualstudio">Running
  tests with Visual Studio</a> in the Getting Started documentation.
</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A new <code>NoAutoReporters</code> switch can be set in the <code>RunSettings</code> file
    to disable environmental reporters (like TeamCity and AppVeyor).
  </li>
</ul>
