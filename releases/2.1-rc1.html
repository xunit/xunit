<h1>Release Notes: September 6, 2015</h1>

<p>
  With this release, the core xUnit.net framework has been moved to release
  candidate, while the DNX runner will continue on its beta path. There have
  been significant improvements in the core framework that are ready for
  production use, whereas the DNX runner remains on a beta path while DNX
  itself does.
</p>

<h2>xUnit.net 2.1 RC 1</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A new <code>IAsyncLifetime</code> interface is available, which can be
    placed onto test classes, class fixtures, and collection fixtures. This
    allows asynchonous initialization (<code>InitializeAsync</code>) and
    cleanup (<code>DisposeAsync</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed several bugs with DNX, especially when running
    under Mono on Linux and OS X.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> The 'unlimited' thread option wasn't working
    correctly (it was incorrectly limiting the active threads).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> The <code>&lt;collection&gt;</code> elements were
    not correctly generated in the XML output (tests were not always grouped
    into the correct collection).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Using a <code>Task</code> in theory data might cause
    the discoverer to hang while it attempted to create a string representation
    of the task.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> There was an issue ordering test cases when running
    on UWP. Now, test cases are always randomized (with no attempt at stability)
    for tests running on UWP.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Some theories passing <code>Type</code> objects from
    types in the GAC could cause the Visual Studio runner to fail.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> There was an error in the implementation of worker
    threads that could cause unexpected failures of the test platform itself.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuration File</h3>

<p><em>
  For information on using configuration files with xUnit.net, see
  <a href="../docs/configuration-files">Configuration Files</a>.
</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You can now use <code>&lt;AssemblyName&gt;.xunit.runner.json</code> instead of
    just <code>xunit.runner.json</code> if you need to be able to disambiguate
    between configuration files for multiple test assemblies in the same
    output folder.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new <code>shadowCopy</code> configuration file element was added, a
    boolean value with a default of <code>true</code>. This value is only used
    when app domains are being used; it is ignored when app domains are not
    available or not being used.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>useAppDomain</code> configuration file element was renamed
    to <code>appDomain</code> and it value is now an enumeration rather
    than a boolean. This value is only used when app domain support is
    available (unit tests that target the desktop CLR, being run by a
    desktop runner).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The platform-specific execution and runner libraries have been replaced with
    just two libraries: <code>desktop</code> (for anything which targets the
    desktop CLR only, and includes support for app domains), and
    <code>dotnet</code> (for everything else, including PCLs, which does not
    include support for app domains). The new runner libraries can run older tests,
    but the older runner libraries cannot run the newer <code>dotnet</code> tests
    (since it's a new platform), so runner authors for non-desktop platforms are
    strongly encouraged to upgrade to the 2.1 runner libraries for maximum
    compatibility. Developers who write extensions to xUnit.net can now do so
    with just two versions instead of eight.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new class called <code>AssemblyRunner</code> has been added to the
    <code>xunit.runner.utility</code> library which makes it easy to write a
    simple test runner. This is useful for developers who want to reuse the
    test framework in an embedded fashion (for example, as a Best Practices
    Analyzer). There is a <a href="https://github.com/xunit/samples.xunit/tree/master/TestRunner">sample
    project</a> which shows how it is used.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Console Runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added a <code>-failskips</code> switch which turns skipped tests into
    failures.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a <code>-namespace</code> filter which allows for filtering tests
    based on their namespace. This filter works for partial namespaces; for
    example, passing </code>-namespace Foo</code> would run tests in the
    <code>Foo</code> namespace, plus tests in all the child namespaces of
    <code>Foo</code> (like <code>Foo.Bar</code> or <code>Foo.Bar.Baz</code>).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>MSBuild Runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added a <code>FailSkips="true"</code> attribute which turns skipped tests
    into failures.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Visual Studio Runner 2.1 RC 1</h2>

<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see
  <a href="../docs/running-tests-in-vs.html">Running xUnit.net tests in Visual
  Studio</a>.
</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Visual Studio runner will respect the new <code>shadowCopy</code> option
    in configuration files. Note: if you turn off shadow copying, then your
    test assembly files will be locked during discovery and execution, preventing
    you from building or cleaning your project.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>DNX Runner 2.1 Beta 5</h2>

<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from DNX projects, see
  <a href="../docs/getting-started-dnx.html">Getting Started with DNX</a>.
</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Added support for DNX 1.0 Beta 7. This runner <strong>will not work</strong>
    with previous versions of DNX, because of extensive changes to the DNX
    framework itself.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a <code>-namespace</code> filter which allows for filtering tests
    based on their namespace. This filter works for partial namespaces; for
    example, passing </code>-namespace Foo</code> would run tests in the
    <code>Foo</code> namespace, plus tests in all the child namespaces of
    <code>Foo</code> (like <code>Foo.Bar</code> or <code>Foo.Bar.Baz</code>).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Devices Runner 1.2 RC 3</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    The view models are now display platform independent, and some of the
    runners are using native UI elements rather than Xamarin Forms. This should
    allow further device runners to be added without a reliance on the
    available of Xamarin Forms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Updated UWP support, including support for .NET Native. There are currently two
    known issues with .NET Native:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/571">Theories fail to enumerate correctly</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/572">Code optimization can generate incorrect stack traces</a></li>
    </ul>
    Using a Debug build of your unit tests can work around these issues for now.
  </li>
</ul>
