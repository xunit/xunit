<h1>Release Notes: February 19, 2017</h1>

<h2>Hello, 2.2!</h2>

<p>
  Today, we're shipping xUnit.net 2.2. This includes 2.2 RTM builds of the core
  framework and the Visual Studio runner.
</p>
<p>
  It has been approxiately 17 months since we shipped 2.1. The delay of the final
  release of 2.2 had been pushed back to align roughly with the release of
  .NET Core 1.0. While that was released back in June of last year, the pieces we relied
  upon (namely, the .NET CLI SDK) have remained in pre-release; their RTM is
  just a couple weeks away with the shipping of Visual Studio 2017.
</p>
<p>
  We have just begun work on a new runner for .NET Core which will supplant (and
  dramatically improve) the command-line test runner experience when compared to
  <code>dotnet test</code>. Beta releases of that runner will start shipping soon.
</p>
<p>
  Once again, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success
  of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. We had too many
  contributors this time around to thank individually, so know that every bug
  reported, every line of code PR'd, every conversation contributed to on Slack,
  were all appreciated!
</p>
<p>
  Important note: If you are using Visual Studio 2013, you must use NuGet 2.12 or
  later to use xUnit.net 2.2, because support for <code>netstandard</code> is
  required. You will not be able to use xUnit.net 2.2 with Visual Studio 2012
  (if Visual Studio 2012 support is important, please stick with xUnit.net 2.1).
</p>

<h2>What's New</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    The minimum version of .NET required for desktop CLR unit tests is now
    .NET 4.5.2. This change was made since both 4.5 and 4.5.1 are now out
    of official support. This change only affects your unit test projects;
    your production code is still free to target lower versions of .NET.
    (Note: Because we support <code>netstandard1.1</code>, you will still
    be able to link your desktop unit test projects that target 4.5 and
    4.5.1, but they will not show up in the Visual Studio runner, and
    they will not get desktop features like AppDomain isolation. Make sure
    you upgrade the .NET version of your projects <em>before</em> installing
    the new NuGet packages.)
  </li>
  <li>
    We have removed support for Windows 8.x Store applications, as well
    as Windows Phone 8.x applications. We continue to support Universal
    Windows applications (from Windows 10 RTM forward). The removal of this
    support also affects the Visual Studio runner. For users who continue to
    need to target these outdated platforms, they should stick with version
    2.1 of both xUnit.net and the Visual Studio runner.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Visual Studio runner has been updated to support .NET Core in Visual
    Studio 2017, as well as from the command line (with <code>dotnet test</code>).
    Both the .NET CLI SDK and Visual Studio 2017 ship with templates for
    making xUnit.net projects. (Note: .NET Core support is limited to Visual
    Studio 2017--aka, MSBuild SDK-style projects. We have discontinued support
    for Visual Studio 2015--aka, project.json-style projects.)
  </li>
  <li>
    We have enabled support for detecting when tests may be running too long.
    This feature is turned off by default, but can be enabled in your
    <a href="../docs/configuration-files">configuration file</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Several new and improved assertions, including:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added support for <code>IStructuralEquatable</code> to
        <code>Assert.Equal</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved <code>Assert.All</code> to include the failing item when
        reporting assertion failures
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved <code>Assert.Collection</code> to include the collection when
        reporting assertion failures
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved handling of multi-rank arrays so that <code>[1,2]</code> and
        <code>[[1],[2]]</code> no longer incorrectly show as equal
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved handling of <code>ISet</code> implementations which are either
        not generic, or have more generic parameters than just the item type
      </li>
      <li>
        Properly disposing enumerators in <code>Assert.Empty</code> and
        <code>Assert.NotEmpty</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/hughbe">Hugh Bellamy</a> for
    contributing to most of this work.
  </li>
  <li>
    We have moved to traditional symbols packages, away from the previous practice
    of including "munged" symbols which automatically downloaded source files from
    GitHub. This was done to support portable PDB files, but has the additional
    benefit of making smaller packages (since the PDB file is no longer included).
    These symbols are hosted at: <code>https://nuget.smbsrc.net/</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
