<h1>Release Notes: September 27, 2015</h1>

<h2>Hello, 2.1!</h2>

<p>
  Today, we're shipping xUnit.net 2.1. This includes 2.1 RTM builds of the core
  framework and the Visual Studio runner.
</p>
<p>
  It has been approximately 6 months since we shipped 2.0. Since that release
  was a ground-up rewrite, we spent the intervening time listening to developer
  feedback, improving the core framework as well as adding features that we
  weren't able to get into 2.0.
</p>
<p>
  The DNX runner continues to remain in beta, tracking individual releases of the
  DNX framework; we expect that it will reach RTM when DNX does, early in 2016.
  Today's release includes a refreshed DNX runner Beta 5 build
  (<code>2.1.0-beta5a-build188</code>) which is linked against xUnit.net 2.1 RTM.
</p>
<p>
  Once again, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success
  of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. With this release
  including new support for Universal Windows Applications, we leaned heavily
  again on <a href="https://github.com/onovotny">Oren Novotny</a> and the team
  at Microsoft responsible for the Universal Windows tooling.
</p>

<h2>What's New</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Added support for Universal Windows Applications. For information about
    getting started with UWP, you can see our documentation:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../docs/getting-started-uwp.html">Running tests inside Visual Studio</a></li>
      <li><a href="../docs/getting-started-devices-uwp.html">Running tests with Devices Runner</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    A configuration feature (via <code>App.config</code>) was part of the 2.0
    release, but only available to desktop unit tests. Configuration in 2.1
    now includes JSON support, and is available on all platforms (assuming
    that the runner correctly reads and obeys the configuration file, of
    course). For more information, see
    <a href="../docs/configuration-files">Configuration Files</a></li>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a new <code>IAsyncLifetime</code> interface, which can be implemented
    by test classes and fixture classes to get asynchronous lifetime support
    (creation and disposal). This should make writing asynchronous setup and
    teardown code much simpler, because developers can use the <code>async</code>
    keyword.
  </li>
  <li>
    Class fixture classes can now use constructor injection to get access to
    collection fixtures.
  </li>
  <li>The <code>[ClassData]</code> attribute has be brought back.</li>
  <li>
    Attributes which derive from <code>BeforeAfterTestAttribute</code> can now
    be decorated onto test collection definition classes, and will be run for
    all tests in the test collection.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added support for desktop projects to run without app domains (in the console
    and MSBuild runners). This substantially improves startup and execution
    performance, at the cost of isolation.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new <code>AssemblyRunner</code> class was added to the runner utility
    libraries, that makes it substantially simpler for users who want to
    leverage xUnit.net to do non-testing activities (for example, to write
    a Best Practices Analyzer). Sample code:
    <a href="https://github.com/xunit/samples.xunit/blob/master/TestRunner/Program.cs">https://github.com/xunit/samples.xunit/blob/master/TestRunner/Program.cs</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    A new extensibility feature was added to the text-based runners (console,
    MSBuild, and DNX) which allows developers to completely control the output
    from the runner. This feature&mdash;runner reporters&mdash;is how support
    for TeamCity and AppVeyor is implemented now.
  </li>
  <li>
    Runners which will immediately execute tests (like the console and MSBuild
    runners) no longer pre-enumerate theory data, to help improve discovery
    performance and reduce memory usage.
  </li>
  <li>Removed support for Windows 8 applications.</li>
  <li>
    The execution libraries (<code>xunit.execution.*.dll</code>) that shipped in
    2.0 were consolidated down in two: <code>xunit.execution.desktop.dll</code>
    (for desktop usage, including AppDomain support) and
    <code>xunit.execution.dotnet.dll</code> (for all other usage, including
    DNX, Windows, Windows Phone, Android, and iOS). By reducing the execution
    library count from 7 to 2, it makes it simpler for developers to provide
    extensions to the testing framework.
  </li>
  <li>
    The runner utility libraries (<code>xunit.runner.utility.*.dll</code>) were
    also reduced down to two: <code>xunit.runner.utility.desktop.dll</code>
    (which can run all tests) and <code>xunit.runner.utility.dotnet.dll</code>
    (which can run tests linked again <code>xunit.execution.dotnet.dll</code>).
    Since the runner libraries are intended to be backward compatible, they
    can run tests written against xUnit.net 1.9.2 and 2.0.
  </li>
</ul>
