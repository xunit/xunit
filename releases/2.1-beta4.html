<h1>Release Notes: August 4, 2015</h1>

<h2>xUnit.net 2.1 Beta 4</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for Universal Windows Platform.</li>
  <li>Added support for DNX Beta 6.</li>
  <li>Added support for the new <code>dotnet</code> NuGet target framework.</li>
  <li>
    Added the ability to <a href="../docs/configuration-files">configure
    your unit test projects using JSON</a>, supported by all project types.
    The <code>App.config</code>-based configuration system continues to be
    supported for desktop and PCL projects only.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added output into the default runner reporter, so the three text-based
    runners (console, MSBuild, and DNX) should now show test output.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can now use constructor injection to get access to your collection
    fixtures from within your class fixtures' constructors.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using <code>BeforeAfterTestAttribute</code>-derived classes is now supported
    on test collection definitions (in addition to being supported on test
    classes and test methods).
  </li>
  <li>Brought back <code>[ClassData]</code> from the v1.x code base.</li>
  <li>
    Improved reporting of serialization issues (mostly affects the Visual Studio
    runner).
  </li>
  <li>
    The paths used by the NuGet packages for PCL259 libraries have been
    made shorter. Hopefully this will alleviate some issues related to
    exceeding <code>MAX_PATH</code> on the file system when using xUnit.net.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> The serialization system could not correct roundtrip
    <code>float.MinValue</code>, <code>float.MaxValue</code>,
    <code>double.MinValue</code> or <code>double.MaxValue</code>. This primarily
    affect theories using these values, when run in Visual Studio.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Environmentally enabled reporters (like TeamCity and
    AppVeyor) should override explicitly chosen reporters.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> xUnit.net was unable to load signed test assemblies.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Runner authors can now opt out of using app domains when running on
    the desktop CLR. The flag is passed to <code>XunitFrontController</code>,
    <code>Xunit1</code>, <code>Xunit2</code>, and <code>Xunit2Discoverer</code>.
    This is a breaking API change, so that authors will be aware of the impact
    of this potential change.
  </li>
  <li>
    The discovery systems in <code>FactAttributeDiscoverer</code> and
    <code>TheoryAttributeDiscoverer</code> have been enhanced
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <code>ITestFrameworkExecutionStarting</code> and
    <code>ITestFrameworkExecutionFinished</code> messages for runner reporters.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <code>TestInvoker.CallTestMethod</code> as an extensibility point.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed a bug where types which implemented
    <code>IXunitSerializable</code> but did not actually serialize anything
    were not working.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Console Runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added a </code>-noappdomain</code> switch to disable using app domains.</li>
  <li><strong>BUG:</strong> XSL-T transforms were being opened as read/write</li>
</ul>

<h3>MSBuild Runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added an <code>AppDomains</code> property to the <code>xunit</code> task, to
    disable using app domains.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>TestDriven.NET runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Turned off shadow copying when using TestDriven.NET. This was the behavior
    in v1.x, but it was inadvertantly turned on when the code was moved to 2.0.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Visual Studio Runner 2.1 Beta 4</h2>

<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see
  <a href="../docs/running-tests-in-vs.html">Running xUnit.net tests in Visual
  Studio</a>.
</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Added support for Universal Windows Platform. To write unit tests for UWP,
    create a new UWP unit test project, then remove the reference to MSTest.
    Add your xUnit.net package references.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added support for using traits to filter tests when using
    <code>vstest.console.exe</code> and Visual Studio Online.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a bunch of new diagnostic messages, which should help when debugging
    test discovery and execution issues.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where some tests may not have been
    run when using Visual Studio 2015 (in particular, theories from v1.x or
    any v2 theory will non-serializable data).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with test discovery being broken when
    the display name of a test is longer than ~ 450 characters.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>DNX Runner 2.1 Beta 4</h2>

<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from DNX projects, see
  <a href="../docs/getting-started-dnx.html">Getting Started with DNX</a>.
</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Added support for DNX Beta 6.</li>
  <li>
    The <code>xunit.assert.source</code> NuGet package is now usable via DNX.
    Unlike with older services, you will not see (or be able to edit) the
    source for the built-in assertions, but you can extend the built-in
    <code>Assert</code> class (which is a partial class).
  </li>
  <li>
    Due to the switch to <code>dotnet</code> libraries for DNX, the ability to
    limit the number of threads running tests has been temporarily removed from
    the DNX runner. This functionality will be restored once <code>dnx451</code>
    is retired, as the feature now requires <code>dnx46</code>. You can still
    enable/disable parallelism (and when enabled, the system will use the
    built-in thread pool to run the tests).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> If the destination folder for the XML report does
    not exist, it will be created.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where the DNX runner would append
    to the XML file when writing the XML report, rather than overwriting it
    (as was intended).
  </li>
</ul>
