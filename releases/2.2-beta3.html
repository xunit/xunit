<p>
  Since the last release, we have moved to <a href="https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/">The
  .NET Foundation</a>. The most visible sign of this is that you'll see the foundation
  CLA bot monitoring our pull requests. We are also operating under their
  <a href="https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.
  Thank you to the .NET Foundation for our new home!

<h2>xUnit.net 2.2 Beta 3</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Test discovery and execution performance has been dramatically improved when
    app domains are being used (the default behavior). This performance improvement
    requires runner changes; the shipped runners (Console, MSBuild, TestDriven.Net,
    and Visual Studio) have all been updated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for detecting hung unit tests has been added. It is a configuration
    option which can be enabled in your
    <a href="../docs/configuration-files">configuration file</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for F# async tests was added. For an example of how to write an F#
    async test, please see our
    <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/2f3be8c3b8a43abe93302df44dcefbc259cfcc91/test/test.xunit.runner.utility/Frameworks/v2/Xunit2Tests.cs#L240-L249">acceptance
    test</a> for this feature.
  </li>
  <li>Performance of the AppVeyor runner reporter was improved.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where async fixtures could end up
    being initialized multiple times.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> The automatic environmental support for the AppVeyor
    and TeamCity runner reporters was incorrectly triggering if the environment
    variable was present (but empty).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Assertion library</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for using NuGet v3 to pull in Assert as source.</li>
  <li>
    <code>xunit.assert.source</code> is now correctly marked as a development-time
    dependency in the NuGet package.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Console runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A new <code>-noautoreporters</code> switch was added to disable any automatic
    environmentally enabled runner reporters (for example, AppVeyor or TeamCity).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>MSBuild runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A new <code>NoAutoReporters</code> property was added to disable any automatic
    environmentally enabled runner reporters (for example, AppVeyor or TeamCity).
  </li>
  <li>
    The deprecation properties <code>TeamCity</code> and <code>Verbose</code>
    were officially removed. The <code>Reporter</code> property (with a value of
    <code>teamcity</code> or <code>verbose</code>) should be used instead.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A new interface <code>IMessageSinkWithTypes</code> was added as part of the
    work to dramatically improve the discovery and execution performance of
    v2 unit tests. Runners which have custom message sinks should implement this
    new interface rather than the older <code>IMessageSink</code> interface.
    Most of the methods in the system have been updated (or extended) to accept
    both interface types. When that wasn't possible, two classes were added that
    can wrap implementations of one into the other (for more information, see
    <code>MessageSinkAdapter.Wrap</code> and
    <code>MessageSinkWithTypesAdapter.Wrap</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    The visitor classes (based on <code>IMessageSink</code>) have been deprecated
    due to their poor performance. New event-based sink classes (based on
    <code>IMessageSinkWithTypes</code>) have replaced them. The new sink classes
    use events that can be subscribed to; these replace the old virtual methods
    in the visitor classes. The new sink classes have a significantly improved
    class hiearchy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Runner reporter authors should return message hanlders that implement both
    <code>IMessageSink</code> and <code>IMessageSinkWithTypes</code> for best
    compatibility and performance. The <code>DefaultRunnerReporter</code> and
    <code>DefaultRunnerReporterMessageHandler</code> base classes has been
    deprecated, and replaced with <code>DefaultRunnerReporterWithTypes</code> and
    <code>DefaultRunnerReporterWithTypesMessageHandler</code>, which implement
    the new high-performance message sink interface.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>TestDiscoverySink</code> now includes the ability to cancel test
    discovery; <code>TestDiscoveryVisitor</code> did not include this ability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with null refs happening in
    <code>TestRunner.cs</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Visual Studio Runner 2.2 Beta 3</h2>

<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see
  <a href="../docs/getting-started-desktop.html#run-tests-visualstudio">Running
  tests with Visual Studio</a> in the Getting Started documentation.
</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with unit test DLL paths that surfaced
    when using <code>vstest.console.exe</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with source information for referenced
    assemblies (other than the assembly under test), which would manifest as
    misisng source information for test base classes in other assemblies.
  </li>
</ul>
