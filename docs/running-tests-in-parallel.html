<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  Running unit tests in parallel is a new feature in xUnit.net version 2. There
  are two essential motivations that drove us to not only enable parallelization,
  but also for it to be a feature that's enabled by default:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    As unit testing has become more prevalent, so too have the number of unit
    tests. It is not unusual for a project to have thousands&#x2014;or tens of
    thousands&#x2014;of unit tests. Developers want the safety of being able to
    quickly run all these tests before committing their code.
  </li>
  <li>
    A typical developer machine in 2006 (when we first started working on
    xUnit.net) had a single or dual core CPU, and perhaps 2 GB of RAM. Today's
    modern developer machine is likely to have a CPU with 8 virtual cores and
    between 8 and 16GB of RAM (or more). These CPUs go to waste when only one
    of them at a time can be assigned to a given task.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  There are really two ways to take advantage of all these extra resources:
  write tests which themselves use parallelization (so that when the system is
  only running a single test, it still takes advantage of all the resources);
  or, let the unit test framework run many tests at the same time, to help
  take advantage of the available resource.
</p>

<p>
  The typical structure of a unit test is to test a single thing in relative
  isolation. This doesn't give much opportunity for the test itself to become
  parallelized, unless the code under test is itself parallelized. Therefore,
  the best way to ensure that unit tests can run at the full speed of the host
  computer is to run many of them at the same time.
</p>

<h2 id="runners-and-test-frameworks">Runners and Test Frameworks</h2>

<p>
  For the purposes of this section, it's important to separate the two actors
  that participate in running your unit tests.
</p>

<p>
  The first is the <em>runner</em>, which is the program (or third party plugin
  to a program) that is responsible for looking for one or more test assemblies,
  and then activating the test frameworks that it finds therein. It generally
  contains very little knowledge about how the test frameworks work, and instead
  relies on <code>xunit.runner.utility</code> to do most of the heavy lifting.
  Through the runner utility library, it can discover <em>test cases</em> and
  then ask for them to be run. It does not itself understand how this discovery
  or execution works, but instead relies on the runner utility library to
  understand those details.
</p>

<p>
  The second is the <em>test framework</em>, which is the code that has the
  detailed knowledge of how to discover and run unit tests. These libraries are
  the ones that the unit tests themselves link against, and so those DLLs live
  along side the unit test code itself. For xUnit.net v1, that is
  <code>xunit.dll</code>; for v2, it's <code>xunit.core.dll</code> (and,
  indirectly, <code>xunit.execution.dll</code>).
</p>

<p>
  There is a third player here that does not have any code, but rather contains
  the abstractions that allow runners and test frameworks to communicate:
  <code>xunit.abstractions.dll</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="parallelism-in-test-frameworks">Parallelism in Test Frameworks</h2>

<p>
  When we say "Parallelism in Test Frameworks", what we mean specifically is
  how a test framework may choose to support running tests <em>within a single
  assembly</em> in parallel with one another. The next section, "Parallelism
  in Runners", we mean how a test runner may choose to support running <em>test
  assemblies</em> in parallel against each other.
</p>

<p>
  As mentioned above, parallelism in the test framework is a feature that's
  new for version 2. Tests written in xUnit.net version 1 cannot be run in
  parallel against each other in the same assembly, though multiple test
  assemblies linked against v1 are still able to participate in the runner
  parallelism feature described in the next sub-section.
</p>

<p>
  The residual of this section describes features only available for test
  assemblies linked against xUnit.net v2.
</p>

<h3>Test Collections</h3>

<p>
  How does xUnit.net decide which tests can run against each other in parallel?
  It uses a concept called <em>test collections</em> to make that decision.
</p>

<p>
  By default, each test class is a unique test collection. Tests within the
  same test class will not run in parallel against each other. Let's examine
  a very simple test assembly, one with a single test class:
</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
public class TestClass1
{
    [Fact]
    public void Test1()
    {
        Thread.Sleep(3000);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Test2()
    {
        Thread.Sleep(5000);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  When we run this test assembly, we see that the total time spent
  running the tests is approximately 8 seconds. These two tests are in the
  same test class, which means that they are in the same test collection,
  so they cannot be run in parallel against one another.
</p>

<p>
  If we were to put these two tests into separate test classes, like this:
</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
public class TestClass1
{
    [Fact]
    public void Test1()
    {
        Thread.Sleep(3000);
    }
}

public class TestClass2
{
    [Fact]
    public void Test2()
    {
        Thread.Sleep(5000);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Now when we run this test assembly, we see that the total time spent
  running the tests is approximately 5 seconds. That's because <code>Test1</code>
  and <code>Test2</code> are in different test collections, so they are able
  to run in parallel against one another.
</p>

<h3>Custom Test Collections</h3>

<p>
  If we need to indicate that multiple test classes should not be run in
  parallel against one another, then we place them into the same test collection.
  This is simply a matter of decorating each test class with an attribute
  that places them into the same uniquely named test collection:
</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
[Collection("Our Test Collection #1")]
public class TestClass1
{
    [Fact]
    public void Test1()
    {
        Thread.Sleep(3000);
    }
}

[Collection("Our Test Collection #1")]
public class TestClass2
{
    [Fact]
    public void Test2()
    {
        Thread.Sleep(5000);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  This instructs xUnit.net not run these two classes against each other in
  parallel. Our total run time now goes back to approximately 8 seconds, which
  indicates that the tests did indeed run one after another.
</p>

  to share text context, see <a href="shared-context.html">Shared Context</a>.
</em></p>

<h3>Changing Default Behavior</h3>

<p>
  There are several default pieces of behavior that be configured by the
  developer as relates to running tests in parallel. These are all changed
  by applying an assembly level attribute:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Put all test classes into a single test collection by default:<br />
    &nbsp; <code>[assembly: CollectionBehavior(CollectionBehavior.CollectionPerAssembly)]</code><br />
    <em>Default: CollectionBehavior.CollectionPerClass</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Set the maximum number of threads to use when running test in parallel:<br />
    &nbsp; <code>[assembly: CollectionBehavior(MaxParallelThreads = <em>n</em>)]</code><br />
    <em>Default: number of virtual CPUs in the PC</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Turn off parallelism inside the assembly:<br/>
    &nbsp; <code>[assembly: CollectionBehavior(DisableTestParallelization = true)]</code><br />
    <em>Default: false</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Turn off parallelism for specific Test Collection<br />
    &nbsp; <code>[collection: CollectionDefinition(DisableParallelization = true)]</code><br />
    <em>Default: false</em><br />
    Parallel-capable test collections will be run first (in parallel), followed by parallel-disabled test collections (run sequentially).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  You can only have one of these attributes per assembly; if you want to
  combine multiple behaviors, do it with a single attribute. Also be aware that
  these values affect only this assembly; if multiple assemblies are running
  in parallel against one another, they have their own independent values.
</p>

<h2 id="parallelism-in-runners">Parallelism in Runners</h2>

<p>
  When we say "Parallelism in Runners", what we mean specifically is how a runner
  may choose to run multiple test assemblies in parallel against each other.
  The decision to do this is independent of whether or not any individual test
  assembly is running tests within itself in parallel. Runners are also allowed
  to override some of the behavior within a test framework (like number of
  threads, whether an assembly should run tests within itself in parallel, etc.);
  when they do so, it overrides whatever behavior has been otherwise specified
  (via code or configuration).
</p>

<p>
  There are many runners, and just as many ways to configure parallelism values.
  This section will cover how to specify parallelism values for the built-in
  console and MSBuild runners; you should look at the documentation for any
  third party runners to learn how to configure them.
</p>

<h3>Console Runner</h3>

<p>
  The console runner in xUnit.net v2 is capable of running unit tests from both
  xUnit.net v1 and v2. It can run multiple assemblies at the same time, and
  command line options can be used to configuration the parallelism options
  used when running the tests.
</p>

<p>
  The following command line options can be used to influence parallelism:
</p>

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Option</th><th>Affect</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th><code>-parallel <em>option</em></code></th>
      <td class="wrapped">
        Allows the user to specify which kinds of parallelization should be
        allowed for the test run. The valid option values are:<br />
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><code>none</code></td>
            <td>Turns off all parallelization</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>collections</code></td>
            <td>Parallelizes collections, not assemblies</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>assemblies</code></td>
            <td>Parallelizes assemblies, not collections</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>all</code></td>
            <td>Parallelizes both collections and assemblies</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        The default value is <code>collections</code>.<br />
        <em><strong>Applies to:</strong> xUnit.net v1, v2</em>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th><code>-maxthreads <em>n</em></code></th>
      <td class="wrapped">
        Overrides the maximum number of threads used <em>per assembly.</em> The
        default value is determined by the test framework (for xUnit.net v2, it
        is the number of virtual CPUs in the PC).<br />
        <em><strong>Applies to:</strong> xUnit.net v2</em>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>MSBuild Runner</h3>

<p>
  The MSBuild runner in xUnit.net v2 is capable of running unit tests from both
  xUnit.net v1 and v2. It can run multiple assemblies at the same time, and
  build file options can be used to configuration the parallelism options
  used when running the tests.
</p>

<p>
  The following <code>Xunit</code> task properties can be used to influence
  parallelism:
</p>

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Property</th><th>Affect</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th><code>ParallelizeAssemblies</code></th>
      <td class="wrapped">
        Set to <code>true</code> to run the test assemblies in parallel against
        one other; set to <code>false</code> to run them sequentially.
        The default value is <code>false</code>.<br />
        <em><strong>Applies to:</strong> xUnit.net v1, v2</em>
      </td>
    </tr>
      <th><code>ParallelizeTestCollections</code></th>
      <td class="wrapped">
        Set to <code>true</code> to run the test collections in parallel against
        one other; set to <code>false</code> to run them sequentially.
        The default value is <code>true</code>.<br />
        <em><strong>Applies to:</strong> xUnit.net v2</em>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th><code>MaxParallelThreads</code></th>
      <td class="wrapped">
        Overrides the maximum number of threads used <em>per assembly.</em> The
        default value is determined by the test framework (for xUnit.net v2, it
        is the number of virtual CPUs in the PC).<br />
        <em><strong>Applies to:</strong> xUnit.net v2</em>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="parallelism-via-configuration">Parallelism via Configuration</h2>

<p>
  There are several configuration elements that can influence parallelism. Please
  see <a href="configuration-files">Configuring xUnit.net</a> for more information
  on how to set up configuration files and change parallelism settings.
