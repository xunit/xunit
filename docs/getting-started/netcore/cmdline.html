<h1>Getting Started with xUnit.net</h1>
<h2>Using .NET Core with the .NET SDK command line</h2>

<p>
  In this article, we will demonstrate getting started with xUnit.net and .NET Core,
  showing you how to write and run your first set of unit tests.
</p>

  <li><a href="#run-tests-visualstudio">Run tests with Visual Studio</a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>
  Note: The examples were done with xUnit.net v2.4.1, .NET Core SDK 2.2.103, and
  .NET Core 2.1. The version numbers, paths, and generated templates may differ for
  you, depending on which version you're using. Note that .NET Core 1.x and 2.x are
  supported.
</em></p>

<h2 id="download-dotnet">Download the .NET SDK</h2>

<p>
  As of this writing, the .NET SDK is available for
  <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">download</a> for Windows,
  Linux, and macOS. Once you've downloaded and installed the SDK, open a fresh
  command prompt of your choice (CMD, PowerShell, Bash, etc.) and make sure
  that you can access the CLI by typing <code>dotnet --version</code>. You
  should be rewarded with a single line, describing the version of the
  .NET Core SDK you have installed:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span style="background-color: #ff0">dotnet --version</span>
2.2.103
</pre>

<p><em>
  Note: the first time you run the <code>dotnet</code> command, it may
  perform some post-installation steps. Once these one-time actions are done,
  it will execute your command.
</em></p>

<h2 id="create-project">Create the unit test project</h2>

<p>
  An xUnit.net test project for .NET Core, just like other xUnit.net test projects
  for .NET, starts with a class library. From the command line, create a folder
  for your test project, change into it, and then create the project:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span style="background-color: #ff0">mkdir MyFirstUnitTests</span>
$ <span style="background-color: #ff0">cd MyFirstUnitTests</span>
$ <span style="background-color: #ff0">dotnet new classlib</span>
The template "Class library" was created successfully.

Processing post-creation actions...

Restore succeeded.
</pre>

<p>
  The result of this project template creates a .NET Standard class library. We
  actually want a .NET Core application (since we're writing .NET Core tests),
  so open the generated <code>.csproj</code> file and edit it so that it looks
  like this:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="15.9.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="xunit" Version="2.4.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="xunit.runner.visualstudio" Version="2.4.1" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>We've made two important changes here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    We changed the target framework to <code>netcoreapp2.1</code>, which means
    that our tests will use .NET Core 2.1.x (whatever is the latest version
    installed on our machine);
  </li>
  <li>
    We added a new package references to <code>xunit</code> and
    <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code>. The former is the unit testing framework,
    and the latter is the library that enables support for both command line and
    Visual Studio execution.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now let's verify that everything is working:</p>

<pre>
$ <span style="background-color: #ff0">dotnet test</span>

</pre>

<p>
  Excellent! There were no unit tests to run, because we didn't write any
  yet. Let's do that now.
</p>

<h2 id="write-first-tests">Write your first tests</h2>

<p>
  When you created the project, the project template automatically created a file
  named <code>Class1.cs</code>. Using your favorite text editor, open this file
  and add a couple tests:
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
using Xunit;

namespace MyFirstUnitTests
{
    public class Class1
    {
        [Fact]
        public void PassingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(4, Add(2, 2));
        }

        [Fact]
        public void FailingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(5, Add(2, 2));
        }

        int Add(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now let's go run the tests again and see what happens:</p>

<pre>
$ <span style="background-color: #ff0">dotnet test</span>

<p>
  Now that we've gotten your first unit tests to run, let's introduce one more
  way to write tests: using theories.
</p>

<h2 id="write-first-theory">Write your first theory</h2>

<p>
  You may have wondered why your first unit tests use an attribute named
  <code>[Fact]</code> rather than one with a more traditional name like Test.
  xUnit.net includes support for two different major types of unit tests:
  facts and theories. When describing the difference between facts and theories,
  we like to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Facts</strong> are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions.</em></p>
  <p><em><strong>Theories</strong> are tests which are only true for a particular set of data.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  A good example of this testing numeric algorithms. Let's say you want to
  test an algorithm which determines whether a number is odd or not. If you're
  writing the positive-side tests (odd numbers), then feeding even numbers
  into the test would cause it fail, and not because the test or algorithm
  is wrong.
</p>

<p>
  Let's add a theory to our existing facts (including a bit of bad data, so we
  can see it fail):
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
[Theory]
[InlineData(3)]
[InlineData(5)]
[InlineData(6)]
public void MyFirstTheory(int value)
{
    Assert.True(IsOdd(value));
}

bool IsOdd(int value)
{
    return value % 2 == 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This time when we run our tests, we see a second failure, for our theory that was given 6:</p>

<pre>

<span style="color: #e03030">Test Run Failed.</span>
Test execution time: 4.0307 Seconds
</pre>

<p>
  Although we've only written 3 test methods, the test runner actually ran
  5 tests; that's because each theory with its data set is a separate test.
  Note also that the runner tells you exactly which set of data failed, because
  it includes the parameter values in the name of the test.
</p>

<h2 id="multi-targeting">Running tests against multiple targets</h2>

<p><em>
  These instructions below will work for Windows, but you must take additional steps to be able
  to support multi-targeting on non-Windows OSes. For more information, please see
  <a href="../multi-target/non-windows">Getting Started with Multi-Targeting for non-Windows</a>.
</em></p>

<p>
  Sometimes, you want to write tests and ensure they run against several target
  application platforms. The xUnit.net test runner that we've been using supports
  .NET Core 1.0 or later, as well as Desktop .NET 4.5.2 or later. With a single
  test project, we can have our tests run against multiple target frameworks.
  Open the <code>.csproj</code> file and change this:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>To this:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworks>net452;netcoreapp2.1</TargetFrameworks>
  </PropertyGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Note that in addition to adding a new target framework, we also renamed the
  element from <code>&lt;TargetFramework&gt;</code> (singular) to
  <code>&lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;</code>(plural). You can run against any
  combination of .NET 4.5.2+ and/or .NET Core 1.0+, including multiple
  desktop or .NET Core frameworks (for example, it's legal to have something like
  <code>&lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;net452;net461;net47;netcoreapp1.0;netcoreapp2.0;netcoreapp2.1&lt;/TargetFrameworks&gt;</code>).
</p>

<p>
  Since we changed the <code>.csproj</code> file, we need to remember to re-run
  <code>dotnet restore</code> before trying to run our unit tests. Now when
  we run the tests, you can see that it runs both target frameworks, one after
  another:

<h2 id="run-tests-visualstudio">Running tests with Visual Studio</h2>

<p class="important">
  <strong>If you're having problems discovering or running tests,</strong> you may be a victim
  of a corrupted runner cache inside Visual Studio. To clear this cache, shut down all instances
  of Visual Studio, then delete the folder <code>%TEMP%\VisualStudioTestExplorerExtensions</code>.
  Also make sure your solution is only linked against a single version of the Visual Studio runner
  NuGet package (<code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code>).
</p>

<p>
  If you have Visual Studio Community (or a paid-for version of Visual Studio), you can run your
  xUnit.net tests within Visual Studio's built-in test runner (named Test Explorer). Unfortunately,
  this does not include Express editions of Visual Studio (you should upgrade to the free
  <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx">Community
  Edition</a> instead).
</p>

<p>
  Make sure Test Explorer is visible (go to <code>Test &gt; Windows &gt; Test Explorer</code>). Depending
  on the version of Visual Studio you have, you may need to build your test assembly before tests
  are discovered. After a moment of discovery, you should see the list of discovered tests:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../../../images/running-tests-in-vs/test-explorer.png" width="314" /></p>

<p>
  Click the <code>Run All</code> link in the Test Explorer window, and you should see the results update
  in the Test Explorer window as the tests are run:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../../../images/running-tests-in-vs/test-explorer-post-run.png" width="347" /></p>

<p>
  You can click on a failed test to see the failure message, and the stack trace. You can click on the
  stack trace lines to take you directly to the failing line of code.
</p>
