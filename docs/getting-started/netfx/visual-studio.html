<h1>Getting Started with xUnit.net</h1>
<h2>Using .NET Framework with Visual Studio</h2>

<p>
  In this article, we will demonstrate getting started with xUnit.net, showing
  you how to write and run your first set of unit tests.

<p><em>
  Note: The examples were done with xUnit.net v2.2 and Visual Studio 2017. The version
  numbers, paths, and Visual Studio UI may differ for you, depending on which
  version you're using.
</em></p>

<h2 id="create-class-library">Create a class library project</h2>

<p>
  Let's start by creating a class library project, targeting .NET 4.5.2 (or later).
  Open Visual Studio, and choose <code>File &gt; New &gt; Project</code>:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../../../images/getting-started/new-project.png" width="835" /></p>

<h2 id="add-xunit-ref">Add a reference to xUnit.net</h2>

<p>
  In Solution Explorer, right click the new project, and choose
  <code>Manage NuGet Packages</code>:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../../../images/manage-nuget-packages.png" width="357" /></p>

<p>Now in the NuGet package manager window, take the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Along the top edge, make sure <code>Browse</code> is selected.</li>
  <li>On the upper right side, ensure <code>nuget.org</code> is selected under <code>Package source</code></li>
  <li>In the search box, type <code>xunit</code></li>
  <li>Select the <code>xUnit.net</code> package, and click <code>Install</code></li>
</ol>

<p><img class="border" src="../../../images/add-xunit.png" width="845" /></p>

<p>
  This package (<code>xunit</code>) is what's called a <em>meta-package</em>;
  that is, it's a package that exists just so you can get references to several
  other packages. In particular, it brings packages that include the core unit
  testing framework and the assertion framework. If you open
  <code>packages.config</code>, you'll see all the packages that get
  referenced:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<packages>
  <package id="xunit" version="2.2.0" targetFramework="net452" />
  <package id="xunit.abstractions" version="2.0.1" targetFramework="net452" />
  <package id="xunit.assert" version="2.2.0" targetFramework="net452" />
  <package id="xunit.core" version="2.2.0" targetFramework="net452" />
  <package id="xunit.extensibility.core" version="2.2.0" targetFramework="net452" />
  <package id="xunit.extensibility.execution" version="2.2.0" targetFramework="net452" />
</packages>
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="note">
  When creating a new project with Visual Studio 2017, you may not end up with a <code>packages.config</code>
  file. That's okay: newer versions of Visual Studio place the NuGet package references directly into your
  <code>.csproj</code> file as <code>&lt;PackageReference&gt;</code> elements like you see here in our
  <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit.integration/blob/d6897d6dfe9c4123c9d24f56ca21cba9d664461c/console/v2x_net452/v2x_net452.csproj#L32-L33">xunit.integration</a>
  project. The advantage is that you not only have one fewer file, but you also only have packages
  listed for which you've taken direct references. That makes it easier to differentiate between the
  packages you've chosen to install and the dependencies they bring with them.
</p>

<h2 id="write-first-tests">Write your first tests</h2>

<p>
  When you created the project, Visual Studio automatically created a file
  named <code>Class1.cs</code> and opened it for you. Inside this class, add a
  couple tests:
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
using Xunit;

namespace MyFirstUnitTests
{
    public class Class1
    {
        [Fact]
        public void PassingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(4, Add(2, 2));
        }

        [Fact]
        public void FailingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(5, Add(2, 2));
        }

        int Add(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Build the solution to ensure that the code compiles. Now that you've written
  the first test, we need a way to run it. Let's install the NuGet package with
  the console runner.
</p>

<h2 id="add-xunit-runner-ref">Add a reference to xUnit.net console runner</h2>

<p>
  Once again, right click on the project in Solution Explorer and choose
  <code>Manage NuGet Packages</code>. This time, you're going to search for
  (and install) a package named <code>xunit.runner.console</code>:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../../../images/getting-started/add-xunit-runner-console.png" width="845" /></p>

<p>
  Unlike the previous package (which added references to the unit testing
  framework), this package is what's known as a <em>solution-level package</em>.
  Instead of having assemblies to reference, it adds some tools in your solution
  folder. We will use one of these tools&mdash;the console runner&mdash;to run
  your unit tests.
</p>

<h2 id="run-tests">Run tests with the xUnit.net console runner</h2>

<p>
  Open a command prompt or PowerShell command window. In the window, navigate
  to the root folder of your solution.
</p>

<p>
  To run the console runner, use a command like the one highlighted below. You
  should see output similar to this:
</p>

<pre>
&gt; <span style="background-color: #ff0">packages\xunit.runner.console.2.2.0\tools\xunit.console MyFirstUnitTests\bin\Debug\MyFirstUnitTests.dll</span>

  Discovering: MyFirstUnitTests
  Discovered:  MyFirstUnitTests
  Starting:    MyFirstUnitTests
    <span style="color: #e03030">MyFirstUnitTests.Class1.FailingTest [FAIL]</span>
      Assert.Equal() Failure
      Expected: 5
      Actual:   4
      <span style="color: #a8a8a8">Stack Trace:</span>

  Finished:    MyFirstUnitTests
=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===
   MyFirstUnitTests  Total: 2, Errors: 0, Failed: 1, Skipped: 0, Time: 0.159s
</pre>

<p><em>
  Note: your path names my vary, depending on what name you chose for your
  project and which version of xUnit.net you installed.
</em></p>

<p><em>
  The console runner has several command line options, which include options
  for parallelization, test filtering, and result reporting. To learn more
  about the console runner options, run the console runner with no command
  line options.
</em></p>

<p>
  Now that we've gotten your first unit tests to run, let's introduce one more
  way to write tests: using theories.
</p>

<h2 id="write-first-theory">Write your first theory</h2>

<p>
  You may have wondered why your first unit tests use an attribute named
  <code>[Fact]</code> rather than one with a more traditional name like Test.
  xUnit.net includes support for two different major types of unit tests:
  facts and theories. When describing the difference between facts and theories,
  we like to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Facts</strong> are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions.</em></p>
  <p><em><strong>Theories</strong> are tests which are only true for a particular set of data.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  A good example of this testing numeric algorithms. Let's say you want to
  test an algorithm which determines whether a number is odd or not. If you're
  writing the positive-side tests (odd numbers), then feeding even numbers
  into the test would cause it fail, and not because the test or algorithm
  is wrong.
</p>

<p>
  Let's add a theory to our existing facts (including a bit of bad data, so we
  can see it fail):
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
[Theory]
[InlineData(3)]
[InlineData(5)]
[InlineData(6)]
public void MyFirstTheory(int value)
{
    Assert.True(IsOdd(value));
}

bool IsOdd(int value)
{
    return value % 2 == 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  This time when we compile and run our tests, we see a second failure, for our
  theory that was given 6:
</p>

<pre>
xUnit.net Console Runner (64-bit .NET 4.0.30319.42000)
  Discovering: MyFirstUnitTests
  Discovered:  MyFirstUnitTests
  Starting:    MyFirstUnitTests
    <span style="color: #e03030">MyFirstUnitTests.Class1.MyFirstTheory(value: 6) [FAIL]</span>
      Assert.True() Failure
      Expected: True
      Actual:   False
      <span style="color: #a8a8a8">Stack Trace:</span>
        MyFirstUnitTests\Class1.cs(30,0): at MyFirstUnitTests.Class1.MyFirstTheory(Int32 value)
    <span style="color: #e03030">MyFirstUnitTests.Class1.FailingTest [FAIL]</span>
      Assert.Equal() Failure
      Expected: 5
      Actual:   4
      <span style="color: #a8a8a8">Stack Trace:</span>
        MyFirstUnitTests\Class1.cs(16,0): at MyFirstUnitTests.Class1.FailingTest()
  Finished:    MyFirstUnitTests
=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===
   MyFirstUnitTests  Total: 5, Errors: 0, Failed: 2, Skipped: 0, Time: 0.171s
</pre>

<p>
  Although we've only written 3 test methods, the console runner actually ran
  5 tests; that's because each theory with its data set is a separate test.
  Note also that the runner tells you exactly which set of data failed, because
  it includes the parameter values in the name of the test.
</p>

<h2 id="run-tests-visualstudio">Running tests with Visual Studio</h2>

<p class="important">
  <strong>Important note</strong>: If you've previously installed the xUnit.net Visual Studio
  Runner VSIX (Extension), you must uninstall it first. The Visual Studio runner is only distributed
  via NuGet now. To remove it, to go <code>Tools</code> &gt; <code>Extensions and Updates</code>.
  Scroll to the bottom of the list, and if xUnit.net is installed, uninstall it. This will force
  you to restart Visual Studio.
</p>

<p class="important">
  <strong>If you're having problems discovering or running tests,</strong> you may be a victim
  of a corrupted runner cache inside Visual Studio. To clear this cache, shut down all instances
  of Visual Studio, then delete the folder <code>%TEMP%\VisualStudioTestExplorerExtensions</code>.
  Also make sure your solution is only linked against a single version of the Visual Studio runner
  NuGet package (<code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code>).
</p>

<p>
  If you have Visual Studio Community (or a paid-for version of Visual Studio), you can run your
  xUnit.net tests within Visual Studio's built-in test runner (named Test Explorer). Unfortunately,
  this does not include Express editions of Visual Studio (you should upgrade to the free
  <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx">Community
  Edition</a> instead).
</p>

<p>
  Right click on the project in Solution Explorer and choose <code>Manage NuGet Packages</code>.
  Search for (and install) a package named <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code>:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../../../images/running-tests-in-vs/add-xunit-runner-visualstudio.png" width="981" /></p>

<p>
  Make sure Test Explorer is visible (go to <code>Test &gt; Windows &gt; Test Explorer</code>). Every
  time you build your project, the runner will discover unit tests in your project. After a moment of
  discovery, you should see the list of discovered tests:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../../../images/running-tests-in-vs/test-explorer.png" width="314" /></p>

<p>
  Click the <code>Run All</code> link in the Test Explorer window, and you should see the results update
  in the Test Explorer window as the tests are run:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="../../../images/running-tests-in-vs/test-explorer-post-run.png" width="347" /></p>

<p>
  You can click on a failed test to see the failure message, and the stack trace. You can click on the
  stack trace lines to take you directly to the failing line of code.
</p>

<p><em>
  Note: Only xUnit.net v2 supports pre-enumeration of theories; when discovering theories with v1,
  it will only show a single test method for the theory.
</em></p>

<h2 id="console-return-codes">Console runner return codes</h2>

<p>Starting with version 2.2, the following return codes are used by the console runner:</p>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Return code</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>0</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">The tests ran successfully.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>1</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">One or more of the tests failed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>2</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      The help page was shown, either because it was requested, or because the user did not provide any
      command line arguments.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>3</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      There was a problem with one of the command line options passed to the runner.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>4</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      There was a problem loading one or more of the test assemblies (for example, if a 64-bit only assembly
      is run with the 32-bit test runner).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>0xC000013A (-1073741510)</code></td>
    <td class="wrapped-wide">
      The user canceled the test execution by pressing Ctrl+C.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
