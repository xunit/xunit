<h1>Shared Context between Tests</h1>

<p>
  It is common for unit test classes to share setup and cleanup code (often called
  "test context"). xUnit.net offers several methods for sharing this setup and
  cleanup code, depending on the scope of things to be shared, as well as the
  expense associated with the setup and cleanup code.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#constructor">Constructor and Dispose</a> (shared setup/cleanup
    code without sharing object instances)
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#class-fixture">Class Fixtures</a> (shared object instance across
    tests in a single class)
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#collection-fixture">Collection Fixtures</a> (shared object
    instances across multiple test classes)
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="constructor">Constructor and Dispose</h2>

<p><em>
  <strong>When to use:</strong> when you want a clean test context for every test
  (sharing the setup and cleanup code, without sharing the object instance).
</em></p>

<p>
  xUnit.net creates a new instance of the test class for every test that is run,
  so any code which is placed into the constructor of the test class will be
  run for every single test. This makes the constructor a convenient place to
  put reusable context setup code where you want to share the code without
  sharing object instances (meaning, you get a clean copy of the context
  object(s) for every test that is run).
</p>

<p>
  For context cleanup, add the <code>IDisposable</code> interface to your test
  class, and put the cleanup code in the <code>Dispose()</code> method.
</p>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
public class StackTests : IDisposable
{
    Stack<int> stack;

    public StackTests()
    {
        stack = new Stack<int>();
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        stack.Dispose();
    }

    [Fact]
    public void WithNoItems_CountShouldReturnZero()
    {
        var count = stack.Count;

        Assert.Equal(0, count);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void AfterPushingItem_CountShouldReturnOne()
    {
        stack.Push(42);

        var count = stack.Count;

        Assert.Equal(1, count);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  This structure is sometimes called the "test class as context" pattern,
  since the test class itself is a self-contained definition of the context
  setup and cleanup code. You can even name the test classes after the setup
  context so that it's easier to remember what your starting point is:
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
public class StackTests
{
    public class EmptyStack
    {
        Stack<int> stack;

        public EmptyStack()
        {
            stack = new Stack<int>();
        }

        // ... tests for an empty stack ...
    }

    public class SingleItemStack
    {
        Stack<int> stack;

        public SingleItemStack()
        {
            stack = new Stack<int>();
            stack.Push(42);
        }

        // ... tests for a single-item stack ...
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  At a high level, we're writing tests for the <code>Stack</code> class, and each
  context is a <code>Stack</code> in a given state. To reflect this, we've wrapped
  all the testcontext classes in a parent class named <code>StackTests</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="class-fixture">Class Fixtures</h2>

<p><em>
  <strong>When to use:</strong> when you want to create a single test context
  and share it among all the tests in the class, and have it cleaned up after
  all the tests in the class have finished.
</em></p>

<p>
  Sometimes test context creation and cleanup can be very expensive. If you were
  to run the creation and cleanup code during every test, it might make the tests
  slower than you want. You can use the <em>class fixture</em> feature of
  xUnit.net to share a single object instance among all tests in a test class.
</p>

<p>
  We already know that xUnit.net creates a new instance of the test class for
  every test. When using a class fixture, xUnit.net will ensure that the
  fixture instance will be created before any of the tests have run, and once
  all the tests have finished, it will clean up the fixture object by calling
  <code>Dispose</code>, if present.
</p>

<p>To use class fixtures, you need to take the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Create the fixture class, and put the startup code in the fixture
    class constructor.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the fixture class needs to perform cleanup, implement <code>IDisposable</code>
    on the fixture class, and put the cleanup code in the <code>Dispose()</code>
    method.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add <code>IClassFixture&lt;&gt;</code> to the test class.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the test class needs access to the fixture instance, add it as a
    constructor argument, and it will be provided automatically.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
public class DatabaseFixture : IDisposable
{
    public DatabaseFixture()
    {
        Db = new SqlConnection("MyConnectionString");

        // ... initialize data in the test database ...
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        // ... clean up test data from the database ...
    }

    public SqlConnection Db { get; private set; }
}

public class MyDatabaseTests : IClassFixture<DatabaseFixture>
{
    DatabaseFixture fixture;

    public MyDatabaseTests(DatabaseFixture fixture)
    {
        this.fixture = fixture;
    }

    // ... write tests, using fixture.Db to get access to the SQL Server ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Just before the first tests in <code>MyDatabaseTests</code> is run, xUnit.net
  will create an instance of <code>DatabaseFixture</code>. For each test, it
  will create a new instance of <code>MyDatabaseTests</code>, and pass the shared
  instance of <code>DatabaseFixture</code> to the constructor.
</p>

<p><em>
  <strong>Important note:</strong> xUnit.net uses the presence of the interface
  <code>IClassFixture&lt;&gt;</code> to know that you want a class fixture to
  be created and cleaned up. It will do this whether you take the instance of
  the class as a constructor argument or not. Similarly, if you add the constructor
  argument but forget to add the interface, xUnit.net will let you know that it
  does not know how to satisfy the constructor argument.
</em></p>

<p>
  If you need multiple fixture objects, you can implement the interface as many
  times as you want, and add constructor arguments for whichever of the fixture
  object instances you need access to. The order of the constructor arguments
  is unimportant.
</p>

<p>
  Note that you cannot control the order that fixture objects are created, and
  fixtures cannot take dependencies on other fixtures. If you have need to
  control creation order and/or have dependencies between fixtures, you should
  create a class which encapsulates the other two fixtures, so that it can
  do the object creation itself.
</p>

<h2 id="collection-fixture">Collection Fixtures</h2>

<p><em>
  <strong>When to use:</strong> when you want to create a single test context
  and share it among tests in several test classes, and have it cleaned up
  after all the tests in the test classes have finished.
</em></p>

<p>
  Sometimes you will want to share a fixture object among multiple test classes.
  The database example used for class fixtures is a great example: you may want
  to initialize a database with a set of test data, and then leave that test
  data in place for use by multiple test classes. You can use the <em>collection
  fixture</em> feature of xUnit.net to share a single object instance among
  tests in several test class.
</p>

<p>To use collection fixtures, you need to take the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Create the fixture class, and put the startup code in the fixture
    class constructor.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the fixture class needs to perform cleanup, implement <code>IDisposable</code>
    on the fixture class, and put the cleanup code in the <code>Dispose()</code>
    method.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create the collection definition class, decorating it with the
    <code>[CollectionDefinition]</code> attribute, giving it a unique name
    that will identify the test collection.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add <code>ICollectionFixture&lt;&gt;</code> to the collection definition
    class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the <code>[Collection]</code> attribute to all the test classes that
    will be part of the collection, using the unique name you provided to the
    test collection definition class's <code>[CollectionDefinition]</code>
    attribute.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the test classes need access to the fixture instance, add it as a
    constructor argument, and it will be provided automatically.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
public class DatabaseFixture : IDisposable
{
    public DatabaseFixture()
    {
        Db = new SqlConnection("MyConnectionString");

        // ... initialize data in the test database ...
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        // ... clean up test data from the database ...
    }

    public SqlConnection Db { get; private set; }
}

[CollectionDefinition("Database collection")]
public class DatabaseCollection : ICollectionFixture<DatabaseFixture>
{
    // This class has no code, and is never created. Its purpose is simply
    // to be the place to apply [CollectionDefinition] and all the
    // ICollectionFixture<> interfaces.
}

[Collection("Database collection")]
public class DatabaseTestClass1
{
    DatabaseFixture fixture;

    public DatabaseTestClass1(DatabaseFixture fixture)
    {
        this.fixture = fixture;
    }
}

[Collection("Database collection")]
public class DatabaseTestClass2
{
    // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  xUnit.net treats collection fixtures in much the same way as class fixtures,
  except that the lifetime of a collection fixture object is longer: it is
  created before any tests are run in any of the test classes in the collection,
  and will not be cleaned up until all test classes in the collection have
  finished running.
</p>

<p>
  Test collections can also be decorated with <code>IClassFixture&lt;&gt;</code>.
  xUnit.net treats this as though each individual test class in the test collection
  were decorated with the class fixture.
</p>

<p>
  Test collections also influence the way xUnit.net runs tests when running them
  in parallel. For more information, see <a href="running-tests-in-parallel.html">Running
  Tests in Parallel</a>.
</p>

<p><em>
  <strong>Important note:</strong> Fixtures can be shared across assemblies, but collection definitions <strong>must</strong> be in the
  same assembly as the test that uses them.
