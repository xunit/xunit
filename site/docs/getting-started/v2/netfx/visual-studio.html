<h1>Getting Started with xUnit.net</h1>
<h2>Using .NET Framework with Visual Studio</h2>

<p>
  In this article, we will demonstrate getting started with xUnit.net, showing
  you how to write and run your first set of unit tests.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#create-project">Create a unit test project</a></li>
  <li><a href="#test-explorer">Learning to use Test Explorer</a></li>
  <li><a href="#write-first-tests">Write your first tests</a></li>
  <li><a href="#write-first-theory">Write your first theory</a></li>
  <li><a href="#multi-targeting">Running tests against multiple target frameworks</a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>
  Note: The examples were done with xUnit.net v2 2.4.1 and Visual Studio 2019. The version
  numbers, paths, and Visual Studio UI may differ for you, depending on which
  version you're using.
</em></p>

<h2 id="create-project">Create a unit test project</h2>

<p>
  Start Visual Studio, which will bring you to the start splash screen. Under "Get Started",
  click "Create a new project". This will bring you to the first step of the new project
  wizard, where you pick your project type:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="/images/getting-started/netcore/new-project-step1-vs2019.png" width="1024" /></p>

<p>
  In the drop down boxes, chooses your language (C#), your platform (All platforms), and your
  project type (Test). Scroll through the list if necessary until you find the item titled
  "xUnit Test Project (.NET Core)". Select it, then click "Next".
</p>

<p class="note">
  We're picking .NET Core even though we're planning to make a .NET Framework test project,
  because Visual Studio doesn't contain a test project template for xUnit.net for .NET
  Framework. We'll fix that in just a moment.
</p>

<p>
  This leads you to the second part of the new project wizard:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="/images/getting-started/netcore/new-project-step2-vs2019.png" width="1024" /></p>

<p>
  Type a name into the "Project name" box (like "MyFirstUnitTests"). Click "Create".
</p>

<p>After a moment, Visual Studio will launch with your newly created project.</p>

<p>
  Find the project in the Solution Explorer (it will be titled "MyFirstUnitTests"), right click it,
  then click "Edit Project File". This will launch the text editor for your project file. It should
  look something like this:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>

    <IsPackable>false</IsPackable>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="16.7.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="xunit" Version="2.4.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="xunit.runner.visualstudio" Version="2.4.3">
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>
    <PackageReference Include="coverlet.collector" Version="1.3.0">
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  We need to make one quick change: use a target framework that indicates .NET Framework
  support. For example, if you want to support .NET Framework 4.8, change the
  <code>TargetFramework</code> element like so:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<TargetFramework>net48</TargetFramework>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Also, if your your project file includes either of these lines:
</p>
  {% highlight xml %}
  <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
  <!-- and / or -->
  <ItemGroup>
    <Using Include="Xunit" />
  </ItemGroup>
  {% endhighlight %}
<p>
  you might get the build error "Feature 'global using directive' is not available in C# 7.3. Please use language version 10.0 or greater."
  If this is the case, you need to remove either line, so it looks like the project file above.
</p>
      
<p>Let's quickly review what's in this project file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>TargetFramework</code> specifies the target framework for your test project. We've
    already changed this to <code>net48</code> for .NET Framework 4.8. Later in this article,
    we will discuss <a href="#multi-targeting">running tests against multiple target frameworks</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>IsPackable</code> is here, though it is redundant (unit test projects cannot be packed
    by default). You can safely remove this line if you wish.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>xunit</code> package brings in three child packages which include functionality
    that most developers want: <code>xunit.core</code> (the testing framework itself),
    <code>xunit.assert</code> (the library which contains the <code>Assert</code> class),
    and <code>xunit.analyzers</code> (which enables Roslyn analyzers to detect common issues
    with unit tests and xUnit.net extensibility).
  </li>
  <li>
    The packages <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code> and <code>Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk</code>
    are required for being able to run your test project inside Visual Studio as well as with
    <code>dotnet test</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>coverlet.collector</code> package allows collecting code coverage. If you don't
    intend to collect code coverage, you should remove this package reference.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A single empty unit test was also generated into <code>UnitTest1.cs</code>:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
using System;
using Xunit;

namespace MyFirstUnitTests
{
    public class UnitTest1
    {
        [Fact]
        public void Test1()
        {

        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Let's make sure everything builds. Choose <code>Build &gt; Build Solution</code> from the
  main menu. Your project should build without issue, as shown in the output window:
</p>

<pre>
Build started...
1>------ Build started: Project: MyFirstUnitTests, Configuration: Debug Any CPU ------
1>MyFirstUnitTests -> C:\Dev\MyFirstUnitTests\bin\Debug\net48\MyFirstUnitTests.dll
========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========
</pre>

<h2 id="test-explorer">Learning to use Test Explorer</h2>

<p>
  Test Explorer is the name of the window that lets you browse and run your tests from within
  Visual Studio. Open it by choosing <code>Test &gt; Test Explorer</code> from the main menu.
  You should be greeted with a window that contains a hierarchy of the tests in your project,
  which should look something like this:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="/images/getting-started/common/test-explorer-newproject-vs2019.png" width="390" /></p>

<p>The toolbar of Test Explorer has buttons in several groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The first group contains buttons that are used for running tests, including the ability
    to run all tests, run selected tests, re-run the last tests, and re-run only the failed
    tests.
  </li>
  <li>
    The second group contains buttons which allow filtering the list of tests based on current
    state (which includes "passed", "failed", and "not run").
  </li>
  <li>
    The third group contains buttons which configure Test Explorer, including advanced options
    like changing processor architecture (x86, x64, or Auto) and automatically running tests
    after every successful build.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The main window of Test Explorer is split into two panes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The left pane contains a tree view of the tests in your project (grouping criteria can be
    changed as you see fit). Columns can be configured to show details about the test,
    including things like the current state, how long the test took to run, metadata (traits)
    related to the test, and more.
  </li>
  <li>
    As you select items in the tree view on the left pane, the right pane will provide information
    about your current selection, including test counts, outcomes, links to the source of the test,
    test output, and exception messages and stack traces for failed tests.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Click the left-most button on the Test Explorer toolbar (it looks like a double green arrow,
  titled "Run All Tests In View". This will run the single empty test, and the result should
  be success:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="/images/getting-started/common/test-explorer-success-vs2019.png" width="738" /></p>

<p>Now that we've ensured everything is working, it's time to write our first real tests.</p>

<h2 id="write-first-tests">Write your first tests</h2>

<p>
  Edit <code>UnitTest1.cs</code> and replace the default file contents with this:
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
using Xunit;

namespace MyFirstUnitTests
{
    public class UnitTest1
    {
        [Fact]
        public void PassingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(4, Add(2, 2));
        }

        [Fact]
        public void FailingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(5, Add(2, 2));
        }

        int Add(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now let's go run the tests again and see what happens:</p>

<p><img class="border" src="/images/getting-started/common/test-explorer-failure1-vs2019.png" width="780" /></p>

<p>
  We purposefully wrote both a passing and failing test, and we can see that the results reflect that.
  By clicking on the failed test, we can see a link both to the top of the unit test (at line 14),
  but also the failure message (we expected 5 but got 4) as well as a link to the exact line where
  the failure occurred (line 16).
</p>

<p>
  When you edit the source file, also take note of the fact that CodeLens decorations show up which
  indicate not only test status (passed/failed) on the test themselves, but also on functions that
  are called by the code, indicating how often the code is called in tests, and a count of which of
  those tests have passed or failed:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="/images/getting-started/common/codelens-status-vs2019.png" width="392" /></p>

<p>
  Now that we've gotten your first unit tests to run, let's introduce one more
  way to write tests: using theories.
</p>

<h2 id="write-first-theory">Write your first theory</h2>

<p>
  You may have wondered why your first unit tests use an attribute named
  <code>[Fact]</code> rather than one with a more traditional name like Test.
  xUnit.net includes support for two different major types of unit tests:
  facts and theories. When describing the difference between facts and theories,
  we like to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Facts</strong> are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions.</em></p>
  <p><em><strong>Theories</strong> are tests which are only true for a particular set of data.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  A good example of this is testing numeric algorithms. Let's say you want to
  test an algorithm which determines whether a number is odd or not. If you're
  writing the positive-side tests (odd numbers), then feeding even numbers
  into the test would cause it fail, and not because the test or algorithm
  is wrong.
</p>

<p>
  Let's add a theory to our existing facts (including a bit of bad data, so we
  can see it fail):
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
[Theory]
[InlineData(3)]
[InlineData(5)]
[InlineData(6)]
public void MyFirstTheory(int value)
{
    Assert.True(IsOdd(value));
}

bool IsOdd(int value)
{
    return value % 2 == 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This time when we run our tests, we see a second failure, for our theory that was given 6:</p>

<p><img class="border" src="/images/getting-started/common/test-explorer-failure2-vs2019.png" width="888" /></p>

<p>
  Although we've only written 3 test methods, the test runner actually ran
  5 tests; that's because each theory with its data set is a separate test.
  Note also that the runner tells you exactly which set of data failed, because
  it includes the parameter values in the name of the test. The Test Explorer
  UI even shows a new level in the tree, as each row of data becomes a test
  result underneath its test method.
</p>

<h2 id="multi-targeting">Running tests against multiple target frameworks</h2>

<p>
  Sometimes, you want to write tests and ensure they run against several target
  application platforms. The xUnit.net test runner that we've been using supports
  .NET Core 1.0 or later, .NET 5.0 or later, and .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later.
  With a single test project, we can have our tests run against multiple target
  frameworks. Open the <code>.csproj</code> file and make the following change.
</p>

<p>Change <code>TargetFramework</code>:</strong></p>

{% highlight xml %}
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net48</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>To <code>TargetFrameworks</code>:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFrameworks>net48;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>
</PropertyGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="note">
  When you change a project file from <code>TargetFramework</code> to
  <code>TargetFrameworks</code> (or back), Visual Studio might show you a yellow
  "alert bar" which indicates that you have to reload the project for your changes
  to take effect. It's best to make this kind of change from a clean environment
  with no dirty text editors, to prevent the possibility of losing any changes.
</p>

<p>
  Test Explorer supports any combination of .NET Core (including .NET 5+)
  and .NET Framework targets. You can even include multiple versions of the same
  target framework (for example, it's legal to have something like
  <code>&lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;net452;net461;net48;netcoreapp2.1;netcoreapp3.1;net5.0&lt;/TargetFrameworks&gt;</code>).
  Application authors will typically only use a single target framework, related to
  the target framework the application is intended to run on. Library authors are more
  likely to use several target frameworks, to ensure their tests run successfully on
  all supported target frameworks.
</p>

<p>
  The Test Explorer tree view will now show your test project multiple times, once for each
  target framework. You can run individual tests from individual frameworks, or you can
  simply run all tests for all frameworks.
